# Cyclone-Fengal-Induced-Flood-and-Landslide-Susceptibility-Mapping
Floods and landslides are common and devastating natural disasters in India, causing significant damage to life and property. Floods frequently affect low-lying and river basin areas, while landslides occur mostly in hilly and mountainous regions. This study aims to assess flood and landslide susceptibility zones using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. Fourteen spatial parameters were considered under Hazard, Vulnerability, and Exposure components, such as rainfall intensity, slope, elevation, land use land cover, drainage density, river proximity, soil type, and geology. The Frequency Ratio method was applied to generate a combined susceptibility map. The result shows that the area falls under high to low-risk zones, for both hazards.
